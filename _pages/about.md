I am a Ph.D. Candidate of the [Department of Computer Science](http://engineering.wayne.edu/cs/) 
at [Wayne State University](https://wayne.edu/) advised by Prof. [Fengwei Zhang](https://fengwei.me)
since 2015. I am also a member of **COMP**uter **A**nd **S**ystem **S**ecurity
([COMPASS](http://compass.cs.wayne.edu)) Lab.

Before starting my Ph.D., I have 4 years of experience in industry. I completed my
Master's degree and Bachelor's degree at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) 
in 2011 and 2008, repectively.

I am interested in different areas of security and privacy, including system security, 
mobile security, IoT security, transportation security, trusted execution environment, 
hardware-assisted security, etc.
